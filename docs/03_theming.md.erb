Fox Tail UI loads a component's theme from the `[component_name]_component.theme.yml` file.
Child components will merge their theme from the Parent Fox Tail UI theme, making it easier to make slight changes.

Steps:

1. Run

    ```shell
    rails g fox_tail:themes
    ```

2. Edit the the individual component `.theme.yml` files under your `app/components/fox_tail` directory.
