**Fox Tail UI is still under development and not intended for production use**

Fox Tail UI is an open-source [View Component](https://viewcomponent.org/) library for Rails built on top of
[Stimulus](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and based on the
[Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/) Design System.

The component library includes all the commonly used components that a website requires, such as buttons, dropdowns, and modals.
